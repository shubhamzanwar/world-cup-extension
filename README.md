# Fifa world cup 2018

A browser extension tool dedicated towards helping you keep up with the current status of the fifa world cup everytime a new tab is opened :)
It displays the current group status, lists the matches of the current day and maintains the live status of on going matches, if any.

Will also include a list of the knockout matches once the group stages pass to keep you informed about when your favorite team is playing ;)

You may find the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fifaworldcup2018/bokkknehmegfggcnebeecinnbiogemfa)

Cheers :coffee:
